# SkimLit_NLP_Project

An NLP model to classify abstract sentences into the role they play (e.g. objective, methods, results, etc..) to enable researchers to skim through the literature and dive deeper when necessary.

## Dataset Used
PubMed 200k RCT dataset

The PubMed 200k RCT dataset is described in Franck Dernoncourt, Ji Young Lee. PubMed 200k RCT: a Dataset for Sequential Sentence Classification in Medical Abstracts. International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (IJCNLP). 2017.
Some miscellaneous information:

PubMed 20k is a subset of PubMed 200k. I.e., any abstract present in PubMed 20k is also present in PubMed 200k.

PubMed_200k_RCT is the same as PubMed_200k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign, except that in the latter all numbers had been replaced by @. (same for PubMed_20k_RCT vs. PubMed_20k_RCT_numbers_replaced_with_at_sign).
